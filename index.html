                <strong>Carl Edward Sagan</strong> (/ˈseɪɡən/; November 9, 1934 – December 20, 1996) was an American
                astronomer,
                planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, poet, and science
                communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including
                experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan
                assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record,
                universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might
                find them. Sagan argued the now-accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be
                attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect.

                <p id="quote">"Last night I attended a special talk on Mars at the Ontario
                    Science Centre by William K. Hartmann, a scientist involved with
                    the Mars Global Surveyor and the author of 'A Traveler's Guide
                    To Mars'...In his talk Dr. Hartmann said that the late Dr. Carl Sagan,
                    unlike the majority of his fellow scientists, never ruled out
                    the possibility of large animals or macrobes moving around the
                    surface of Mars. A geologist working on the two Viking landers
                    that successfully landed on Mars in 1976 said the following:
                    "Carl wanted to rev up the camera in order to see rabbits hop
                    by." (page 76 in 'The Search for Life on Mars' by Henry Cooper).
                    Maybe this strange white object with the two protruding things
                    ... will turn out to be Carl Sagan's "Rabbit" or some similar
                    macrobe."
